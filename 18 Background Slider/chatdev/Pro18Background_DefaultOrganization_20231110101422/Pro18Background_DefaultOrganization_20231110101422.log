In this implementation, we have a main.py file that initializes the photo gallery application using tkinter. The main function creates a Tkinter root window and instantiates the PhotoGallery class.

The photo_gallery.py file contains the PhotoGallery class which is a subclass of tk.Frame. It represents the interactive photo gallery feature. It has a list to store the images and keeps track of the current image index. The class has methods to show the previous and next images, update the displayed image, and add new images to the gallery.

The PhotoGallery class uses tkinter buttons and labels to create the GUI elements. The show_previous_image and show_next_image methods update the current_image index and call the update_image method to display the corresponding image. The add_image method adds a new image to the gallery.

Note: Make sure to have the images in the specified image_path before running the application.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statement for the `tk.PhotoImage` class in the `photo_gallery.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to create a new image using `tk.PhotoImage(file=image_path)`.

To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `photo_gallery.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import PhotoImage
```

This will import the `PhotoImage` class from the `tkinter` module, allowing the code to create new images without any errors.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statement for the `tk.PhotoImage` class in the `photo_gallery.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to create a new image using `tk.PhotoImage(file=image_path)`.

To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `photo_gallery.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import PhotoImage
```

This will import the `PhotoImage` class from the `tkinter` module, allowing the code to create new images without any errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statement for the `PhotoImage` class from the `tkinter` module in the `photo_gallery.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to create an image object. To fix this, add the import statement `from tkinter import PhotoImage` at the top of the `photo_gallery.py` file.

<REVISION> Add the following import statement at the top of the `photo_gallery.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import PhotoImage
```

This will import the `PhotoImage` class from the `tkinter` module and allow the creation of image objects in the `PhotoGallery` class.

According to the new user's task and our software designs: 
Task: "Task is create an interactive photo gallery feature for a website, where users can click on the arrows to navigate through a collection of images.".
Modality: "website".
Programming Language: " Python"
Ideas: ""
Codes:
"main.py

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

        # Create the necessary widgets
        self.image_label = tk.Label(self)
        self.image_label.pack()

        self.prev_button = tk.Button(self, text="Previous", command=self.show_previous_image)

        self.next_button = tk.Button(self, text="Next", command=self.show_next_image)
        self.next_button.pack(side="right")

    def show_previous_image(self):
        if self.current_image_index > 0:
            self.current_image_index -= 1
        self.show_current_image()

    def show_next_image(self):
        if self.current_image_index < len(self.images) - 1:
            self.current_image_index += 1
        self.show_current_image()

    def show_current_image(self):
        image = self.images[self.current_image_index]
        self.image_label.configure(image=image)

    def add_image(self, image_path):

Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

The code has been modified to include the implementation of the PhotoGallery class in the photo_gallery.py file. This class is responsible for creating the interactive photo gallery feature on the website. The class includes methods for showing previous and next images, as well as adding new images to the gallery.

To use the photo gallery feature, you can create an instance of the PhotoGallery class in the main.py file and pack it into the root window. The gallery will then be displayed on the website, and users can click on the arrows to navigate through the collection of images.

Please note that the code assumes the images are stored in the same directory as the main.py file. You can modify the add_image method to handle different image paths if needed.

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file. Based on the provided code, the only dependency required is the `tkinter` package, which is a standard library in Python for creating GUI applications. Therefore, your requirements.txt file should include the following:

requirements.txt

```
tkinter
```

This file specifies that the project requires the `tkinter` package to be installed. You can create this file in the root directory of your project and include it when sharing the project with others.

# Interactive Photo Gallery User Manual

## Introduction

The Interactive Photo Gallery is a feature for a website that allows users to navigate through a collection of images by clicking on arrows. This user manual provides instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies and how to use the software.

## Installation

To use the Interactive Photo Gallery feature, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Tkinter library

You can install the dependencies by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the software files are located.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install the Tkinter library.

## Usage

To use the Interactive Photo Gallery feature, follow these steps:

1. Open the `main.py` file in a Python editor or IDE.
2. Run the `main.py` file to start the application.
3. A window will open displaying the photo gallery.
4. The first image in the collection will be displayed.
5. Click on the "Next" button to navigate to the next image.
6. Click on the "Previous" button to navigate to the previous image.
7. The image will be displayed in the window.

You can add images to the photo gallery by calling the `add_image` method in the `photo_gallery.py` file. Pass the path of the image file as an argument to the method. For example:

```python
gallery.add_image("path/to/image.jpg")
```

## Customization

You can customize the Interactive Photo Gallery by modifying the code in the `photo_gallery.py` file. Here are some possible customizations:

- Change the appearance of the buttons by modifying the button text or styling.
- Add additional buttons or functionality to the photo gallery.
- Modify the layout or design of the photo gallery window.

## Conclusion
