Sure, let's create an interactive photo gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will need the following files:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the photo gallery.
2. styles.css: This CSS file will contain all the styles for our photo gallery.
3. script.js: This JavaScript file will contain the functionality of the photo gallery, such as navigating through images.
4. package.json: This file will contain the project metadata and dependencies.

Let's start with the entry point file:

index.html
