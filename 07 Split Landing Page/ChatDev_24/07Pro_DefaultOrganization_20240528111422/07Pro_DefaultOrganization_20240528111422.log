Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " JavaScript"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  JavaScript. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: These front-end code implement a split landing page that showcases the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles with buy buttons. Additionally, when hovering over one of the consoles, its width expands while the width of the other console shrinks..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To implement the split landing page showcasing the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles with buy buttons, and the hover effect, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will create three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.

First, let's create the `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Gaming Consoles</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="console" id="playstation">
            <h2>PlayStation 5</h2>
            <button class="buy-button">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
        <div class="console" id="xbox">
            <h2>Xbox Series X</h2>
            <button class="buy-button">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, let's create the `style.css` file:

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    width: 100%;
}

.console {
    width: 50%;
    transition: width 0.3s;
}

.console:hover {
    width: 60%;
}

#playstation {
    background-color: #003791;
    color: #fff;
}

#xbox {
    background-color: #107C10;
    color: #fff;
}

h2 {
    margin-top: 0;
}

.buy-button {
    margin-top: 10px;
}
```

Finally, let's create the `script.js` file:

```javascript
// Get the console elements
const playstation = document.getElementById('playstation');
const xbox = document.getElementById('xbox');

// Add event listeners for hover effect
playstation.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    playstation.style.width = '60%';
    xbox.style.width = '40%';
});

xbox.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    xbox.style.width = '60%';
    playstation.style.width = '40%';
});
```

This code will create a split landing page with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles. When hovering over one console, its width will expand while the width of the other console shrinks.

Make sure to save each file with the appropriate file extension (.html, .css, .js) and place them in the same directory. You can then open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the split landing page in action.

The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the JavaScript code, the event listeners are only triggered when the mouse is over the consoles. However, the requirement states that the width of the consoles should expand when hovering over one of them, and shrink when hovering over the other. Currently, the width changes only when the mouse is over the consoles, but it doesn't revert back to the original width when the mouse is moved away.

To fix this, we need to add mouseout event listeners to both consoles, which will reset the width to its original value when the mouse is no longer hovering over them.

Here's the revised JavaScript code:

```js
// Get the console elements
const playstation = document.getElementById('playstation');
const xbox = document.getElementById('xbox');

// Add event listeners for hover effect
playstation.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    playstation.style.width = '60%';
    xbox.style.width = '40%';
});

playstation.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
    playstation.style.width = '50%';
    xbox.style.width = '50%';
});

xbox.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    xbox.style.width = '60%';
    playstation.style.width = '40%';
});

xbox.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
    xbox.style.width = '50%';
    playstation.style.width = '50%';
});
```

With these changes, the width of the consoles will expand and shrink as expected when hovering over them, and revert back to the original width when the mouse is moved away.

Please make the necessary changes and test the code to ensure it functions as intended.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the JavaScript code, the event listeners are only triggered when the mouse is over the consoles. However, the requirement states that the width of the consoles should expand when hovering over one of them, and shrink when hovering over the other. Currently, the width changes only when the mouse is over the consoles, but it doesn't revert back to the original width when the mouse is moved away.

To fix this, we need to add mouseout event listeners to both consoles, which will reset the width to its original value when the mouse is no longer hovering over them.

Here's the revised JavaScript code:

```js
// Get the console elements
const playstation = document.getElementById('playstation');
const xbox = document.getElementById('xbox');

// Add event listeners for hover effect
playstation.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    playstation.style.width = '60%';
    xbox.style.width = '40%';
});

playstation.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
    playstation.style.width = '50%';
    xbox.style.width = '50%';
});

xbox.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    xbox.style.width = '60%';
    playstation.style.width = '40%';
});

xbox.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
    xbox.style.width = '50%';
    playstation.style.width = '50%';
});
```

With these changes, the width of the consoles will expand and shrink as expected when hovering over them, and revert back to the original width when the mouse is moved away.

Please make the necessary changes and test the code to ensure it functions as intended."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code looks good overall, but there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed. In the JavaScript code, the event listeners are not properly removed when the mouse leaves the console elements. This can lead to memory leaks and unnecessary event handling.

To fix this issue, you can modify the JavaScript code as follows:

```js
// Get the console elements
const playstation = document.getElementById('playstation');
const xbox = document.getElementById('xbox');

// Define the event handler functions
const handlePlaystationMouseOver = () => {
    playstation.style.width = '60%';
    xbox.style.width = '40%';
};

const handlePlaystationMouseOut = () => {
    playstation.style.width = '50%';
    xbox.style.width = '50%';
};

const handleXboxMouseOver = () => {
    xbox.style.width = '60%';
    playstation.style.width = '40%';
};

const handleXboxMouseOut = () => {
    xbox.style.width = '50%';
    playstation.style.width = '50%';
};

// Add event listeners for hover effect
playstation.addEventListener('mouseover', handlePlaystationMouseOver);
playstation.addEventListener('mouseout', handlePlaystationMouseOut);
xbox.addEventListener('mouseover', handleXboxMouseOver);
xbox.addEventListener('mouseout', handleXboxMouseOut);
```

By defining separate event handler functions and attaching them as event listeners, we can easily remove the event listeners when needed. This ensures that the event listeners are properly cleaned up and avoids any potential memory leaks.

Please make the above changes to the JavaScript code to address the issue.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed. In the JavaScript code, the event listeners are not properly removed when the mouse leaves the console elements. This can lead to memory leaks and unnecessary event handling.

To fix this issue, you can modify the JavaScript code as follows:

```js
// Get the console elements
const playstation = document.getElementById('playstation');
const xbox = document.getElementById('xbox');

// Define the event handler functions
const handlePlaystationMouseOver = () => {
    playstation.style.width = '60%';
    xbox.style.width = '40%';
};

const handlePlaystationMouseOut = () => {
    playstation.style.width = '50%';
    xbox.style.width = '50%';
};

const handleXboxMouseOver = () => {
    xbox.style.width = '60%';
    playstation.style.width = '40%';
};

const handleXboxMouseOut = () => {
    xbox.style.width = '50%';
    playstation.style.width = '50%';
};

// Add event listeners for hover effect
playstation.addEventListener('mouseover', handlePlaystationMouseOver);
playstation.addEventListener('mouseout', handlePlaystationMouseOut);
xbox.addEventListener('mouseover', handleXboxMouseOver);
xbox.addEventListener('mouseout', handleXboxMouseOut);
```

By defining separate event handler functions and attaching them as event listeners, we can easily remove the event listeners when needed. This ensures that the event listeners are properly cleaned up and avoids any potential memory leaks.

Please make the above changes to the JavaScript code to address the issue."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one potential improvement that can be made to enhance the user experience.

In the script.js file, the event listeners for mouseover and mouseout events are used to handle the width changes of the consoles. While this works, it would be more intuitive to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead. This is because the mouseenter event is triggered when the mouse pointer enters the element, and the mouseleave event is triggered when the mouse pointer leaves the element.

By using mouseenter and mouseleave events, the width changes will only occur when the mouse pointer directly enters or leaves the console elements, rather than triggering the events when the pointer hovers over child elements within the consoles.

To implement this improvement, you need to replace the event types from 'mouseover' and 'mouseout' to 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' respectively in the event listeners.

Here's the updated code snippet for the event listeners:

```js
// Add event listeners for hover effect
playstation.addEventListener('mouseenter', handlePlaystationMouseOver);
playstation.addEventListener('mouseleave', handlePlaystationMouseOut);
xbox.addEventListener('mouseenter', handleXboxMouseOver);
xbox.addEventListener('mouseleave', handleXboxMouseOut);
```

By making this change, the width changes will only occur when the mouse pointer directly enters or leaves the console elements, providing a smoother and more intuitive user experience.

Once you make this change, the code should be ready for use.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one potential improvement that can be made to enhance the user experience.

In the script.js file, the event listeners for mouseover and mouseout events are used to handle the width changes of the consoles. While this works, it would be more intuitive to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead. This is because the mouseenter event is triggered when the mouse pointer enters the element, and the mouseleave event is triggered when the mouse pointer leaves the element.

By using mouseenter and mouseleave events, the width changes will only occur when the mouse pointer directly enters or leaves the console elements, rather than triggering the events when the pointer hovers over child elements within the consoles.

To implement this improvement, you need to replace the event types from 'mouseover' and 'mouseout' to 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' respectively in the event listeners.

Here's the updated code snippet for the event listeners:

```js
// Add event listeners for hover effect
playstation.addEventListener('mouseenter', handlePlaystationMouseOver);
playstation.addEventListener('mouseleave', handlePlaystationMouseOut);
xbox.addEventListener('mouseenter', handleXboxMouseOver);
xbox.addEventListener('mouseleave', handleXboxMouseOut);
```

By making this change, the width changes will only occur when the mouse pointer directly enters or leaves the console elements, providing a smoother and more intuitive user experience.

Once you make this change, the code should be ready for use."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
