According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "These front-end code implement a split landing page that showcases the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles with buy buttons. Additionally, when hovering over one of the consoles, its width expands while the width of the other console shrinks.".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " JavaScript"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  JavaScript. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: These front-end code implement a split landing page that showcases the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles with buy buttons. Additionally, when hovering over one of the consoles, its width expands while the width of the other console shrinks..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we will create three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. 

First, let's create the `index.html` file. This file will contain the HTML structure of the split landing page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="console" id="playstation">
            <h2>PlayStation 5</h2>
            <button class="buy-button">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
        <div class="console" id="xbox">
            <h2>Xbox Series X</h2>
            <button class="buy-button">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, let's create the `style.css` file. This file will define the styles for the split landing page, including the expanding and shrinking effect on hover.

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.console {
    width: 400px;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
    transition: width 0.3s;
}

.console:hover {
    width: 500px;
}

.console:hover ~ .console {
    width: 300px;
}

h2 {
    margin-top: 0;
}

.buy-button {
    margin-top: 20px;
}
```

Finally, let's create the `script.js` file. This file will handle any JavaScript functionality required for the split landing page.

```javascript
// No JavaScript functionality is required for this task.
```

With these files in place, you can now open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the split landing page showcasing the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles. When hovering over one of the consoles, its width will expand while the width of the other console shrinks.

            <h2>Xbox Series X</h2>
            <button class="buy-button">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, let's create the `style.css` file. This file will define the styles for the split landing page, including the expanding and shrinking effect on hover.

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.console {
    width: 400px;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
    transition: width 0.3s;
}

.console:hover {
    width: 500px;
}

.console:hover ~ .console {
    width: 300px;
}

h2 {
    margin-top: 0;
}

.buy-button {
    margin-top: 20px;
}
```

Finally, let's create the `script.js` file. This file will handle any JavaScript functionality required for the split landing page.

```javascript
// No JavaScript functionality is required for this task.
```

With these files in place, you can now open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the split landing page showcasing the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles. When hovering over one of the consoles, its width will expand while the width of the other console shrinks.

The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one comment with the highest priority:

Comment 1: Missing import statements in the HTML file.

In the provided HTML code, there are missing import statements for the CSS and JavaScript files. To fix this, you need to add the import statements for the CSS and JavaScript files in the head section of the HTML file.

Here's the revised code for the index.html file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>

The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one comment with the highest priority:

Comment 1: Missing import statements in the HTML file.

In the provided HTML file (index.html), there are missing import statements for the CSS and JavaScript files. To fix this, you need to add the following lines within the `<head>` section of the HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

By adding these import statements, the CSS styles defined in the style.css file and the JavaScript functionality defined in the script.js file will be properly linked to the HTML file.

Once you make this change, the code should work as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one comment with the highest priority:

Comment 1: Missing import statements in the HTML file.

In the provided HTML file (index.html), there are missing import statements for the CSS and JavaScript files. To fix this, you need to add the following lines within the `<head>` section of the HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

By adding these import statements, the CSS styles defined in the style.css file and the JavaScript functionality defined in the script.js file will be properly linked to the HTML file.

Once you make this change, the code should work as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

# Split Landing Page for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X

To implement a split landing page that showcases the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles with buy buttons, you can use the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Here's how you can set it up:

## Step 1: Set up the HTML structure

Create an `index.html` file and copy the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="console playstation">
            <h2>PlayStation 5</h2>
            <button class="buy-button">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
        <div class="console xbox">
            <h2>Xbox Series X</h2>
            <button class="buy-button">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 2: Style the landing page

Create a `style.css` file and copy the following code:

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.console {
    width: 400px;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
    transition: width 0.3s;
}

.console:hover {
    width: 500px;
}

.console:hover ~ .console {
    width: 300px;
}

h2 {
    margin-top: 0;
}

.buy-button {
    margin-top: 20px;
}
```

## Step 3: Add interactivity (optional)

If you want to add interactivity to the landing page, you can use JavaScript. In this case, no JavaScript functionality is required, so you can leave the `script.js` file empty.

```js
// No JavaScript functionality is required for this task.
```

## Step 4: Test the landing page

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser, and you should see the split landing page showcasing the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles with buy buttons. When you hover over one of the consoles, its width will expand while the width of the other console shrinks.

Feel free to customize the styling and content of the landing page to fit your needs.
