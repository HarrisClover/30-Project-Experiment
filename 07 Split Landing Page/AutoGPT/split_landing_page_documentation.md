# Split Landing Page Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the split landing page implementation and guidance on how to use and troubleshoot the code.

## Overview

The split landing page showcases the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X gaming consoles with buy buttons. The page features an interactive experience where hovering over one console expands its width while shrinking the width of the other console.

## Files

- `split_landing_page_optimized.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the landing page.
- `split_landing_page.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the landing page.
- `split_landing_page.js`: The JavaScript file containing the interactive hover effects.

## Implementation

To implement the split landing page, follow these steps:

1. Place the `split_landing_page_optimized.html`, `split_landing_page.css`, and `split_landing_page.js` files in the same directory.
2. Open the `split_landing_page_optimized.html` file in a web browser to view the landing page.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the landing page, please check the following:

1. Ensure that all the files are in the same directory.
2. Verify that the file paths in the `split_landing_page_optimized.html` file are correct and pointing to the appropriate CSS and JavaScript files.
3. Check the browser console for any error messages or warnings.

If you still experience issues, please consult the resources used during the development of the landing page or seek assistance from a front-end development expert.
