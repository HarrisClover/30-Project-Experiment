To implement this task, we will use Python with Flask for the backend and JavaScript with jQuery for the frontend. We will also use HTML and CSS for the webpage structure and design.

Let's start with the Python backend. We will need a Flask application that serves our HTML page and provides an API endpoint to get the next word or phrase to display.
