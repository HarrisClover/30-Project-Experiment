We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

```

In this implementation, we use the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the interactive text display program. The `TextDisplayApp` class represents the main application window. It contains a label to display the text, a button to manually change the text, and a scale to adjust the speed of text changes.

The `update_text` method is responsible for updating the text label with the next word from the `words` list. It uses the `after` method of the root window to schedule the next update after a certain delay based on the current speed.

The `change_text` method is called when the user clicks the "Change Text" button. It increments the `current_word_index` to move to the next word in the `words` list.

The `update_speed` method is called when the user adjusts the speed scale. It updates the `speed` variable based on the selected value.

Finally, in the `__main__` block, we create an instance of the `TextDisplayApp` class and start the main event loop using the `mainloop` method of the root window.

In this implementation, we use the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the interactive text display program. The `TextDisplayApp` class represents the main application window. It contains a label to display the text, a button to manually change the text, and a scale to adjust the speed of text changes.

The `update_text` method is responsible for updating the text label with the next word from the `words` list. It uses the `after` method of the root window to schedule the next update after a certain delay based on the current speed.

The `change_text` method is called when the user clicks the "Change Text" button. It increments the `current_word_index` to move to the next word in the `words` list.

The `update_speed` method is called when the user adjusts the speed scale. It updates the `speed` variable based on the selected value.

Finally, in the `__main__` block, we create an instance of the `TextDisplayApp` class and start the main event loop using the `mainloop` method of the root window.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statement for the `tkinter` module. To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the code:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will import the `tkinter` module and allow the code to use its classes and functions.

Additionally, the `change_text` method is incomplete. It should update the text label with the next word from the `words` list. To fix this, modify the `change_text` method as follows:

```python
def change_text(self):
    self.current_word_index = (self.current_word_index + 1) % len(self.words)
    self.update_text()
```

This will update the `current_word_index` and then call the `update_text` method to update the text label with the new word.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready for execution.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statement for the `tkinter` module. To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the code:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will import the `tkinter` module and allow the code to use its classes and functions.

Additionally, the `change_text` method is incomplete. It should update the text label with the next word from the `words` list. To fix this, modify the `change_text` method as follows:

```python
def change_text(self):
    self.current_word_index = (self.current_word_index + 1) % len(self.words)
    self.update_text()
```

This will update the `current_word_index` and then call the `update_text` method to update the text label with the new word.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready for execution."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<Comment>
The code looks well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `update_speed` method, the `value` parameter is not being used. To ensure that the speed is updated correctly, you should modify the method as follows:

```python
def update_speed(self, value):
    self.speed = int(value)
    self.root.after_cancel(self.update_text)  # Cancel the previous scheduled update
    self.update_text()  # Schedule a new update with the updated speed
```

This change will cancel the previous scheduled update and schedule a new update with the updated speed value.

Please make this modification to ensure that the speed control works correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `update_speed` method, the `value` parameter is not being used. To ensure that the speed is updated correctly, you should modify the method as follows:

```python
def update_speed(self, value):
    self.speed = int(value)
    self.root.after_cancel(self.update_text)  # Cancel the previous scheduled update
    self.update_text()  # Schedule a new update with the updated speed
```

This change will cancel the previous scheduled update and schedule a new update with the updated speed value.

Please make this modification to ensure that the speed control works correctly."

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one potential bug in the `update_speed` method. When updating the speed, the previous scheduled update is canceled using `self.root.after_cancel(self.update_text)`, but the method should be passed as an argument to `after_cancel` instead of calling it directly. 

<Instructions>
To fix this issue, modify the line `self.root.after_cancel(self.update_text)` to `self.root.after_cancel(self.root.after_id)`. Then, add a new attribute `self.after_id` in the `__init__` method to store the ID returned by `self.root.after`. Finally, update the line `self.root.after(1000 // self.speed, self.update_text)` in the `update_text` method to `self.after_id = self.root.after(1000 // self.speed, self.update_text)`. 

After making these changes, the `update_speed` method should look like this:

```python
def update_speed(self, value):
    self.speed = int(value)
    self.root.after_cancel(self.after_id)  # Cancel the previous scheduled update
    self.after_id = self.root.after(1000 // self.speed, self.update_text)  # Schedule a new update with the updated speed
```

Please make these changes and retest the program to ensure it functions as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one potential bug in the `update_speed` method. When updating the speed, the previous scheduled update is canceled using `self.root.after_cancel(self.update_text)`, but the method should be passed as an argument to `after_cancel` instead of calling it directly. 

<Instructions>
To fix this issue, modify the line `self.root.after_cancel(self.update_text)` to `self.root.after_cancel(self.root.after_id)`. Then, add a new attribute `self.after_id` in the `__init__` method to store the ID returned by `self.root.after`. Finally, update the line `self.root.after(1000 // self.speed, self.update_text)` in the `update_text` method to `self.after_id = self.root.after(1000 // self.speed, self.update_text)`. 

After making these changes, the `update_speed` method should look like this:

```python
def update_speed(self, value):
    self.speed = int(value)
    self.root.after_cancel(self.after_id)  # Cancel the previous scheduled update
    self.after_id = self.root.after(1000 // self.speed, self.update_text)  # Schedule a new update with the updated speed
```

Please make these changes and retest the program to ensure it functions as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file in the following format:

```
tkinter==8.6
```

In this case, the only dependency required is `tkinter`, which is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. The version specified is `8.6`, but you can adjust it based on your specific requirements.

Save the above content in a file named `requirements.txt` and include it in your project directory. This file can be used by package managers like `pip` to install the required dependencies for your project.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file in the following format:
```
tkinter==8.6
```
In this case, the only dependency required is `tkinter`, which is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. The version specified is `8.6`, but you can adjust it based on your specific requirements.
Save the above content in a file named `requirements.txt` and include it in your project directory. This file can be used by package managers like `pip` to install the required dependencies for your project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
