The application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript will be responsible for the logic of the application, including adding, marking as completed, and deleting to-do items, as well as persisting the list in the browser's local storage.

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the to-do list application.

2. styles.css: This file will contain all the CSS styles for the application.

3. script.js: This file will contain the JavaScript code responsible for the application's functionality.

4. package.json: This file will contain the project's metadata and dependencies.

Let's start with the entry point file, index.html:
