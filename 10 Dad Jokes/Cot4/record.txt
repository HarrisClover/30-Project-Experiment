I wanted to have a website that would automatically display a short joke in the middle of the page. Click the "Get Another Joke" button to toggle the display of a joke.Let's think step by step===============================
Step 1: Designing the Website
First, you need to design the website. It should be simple and user-friendly. The main feature of the website will be a button that says "Get Another Joke". When the user first lands on the page, a joke should already be displayed in the middle of the page. 

Step 2: Creating the Joke Database
You need to create a database of jokes. This could be a simple text file with one joke per line, or a more complex database system. The jokes should be short and suitable for all ages.

Step 3: Programming the Button
The "Get Another Joke" button needs to be programmed to fetch a random joke from the database and display it on the page. This could be done using JavaScript or another web programming language.

Step 4: Testing the Website
Before launching the website, you need to test it thoroughly. Make sure the jokes are displayed correctly and the button works as expected. 

Step 5: Launching the Website
Once everything is working correctly, you can launch the website. You might want to promote it on social media or other platforms to attract users.

Step 6: Maintaining the Website
After the website is launched, you need to maintain it. This includes adding new jokes to the database, fixing any bugs that arise, and possibly adding new features based on user feedback. 

Remember, the key to a successful website is a good user experience. Make sure your website is easy to use, visually appealing, and fun.===============================

index.html:

end index.html

style.css:

end style.css

script.js:
```javascript

end script.js===============================
index.html:

    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>

end index.html

style.css:
```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

.container {
    text-align: center;
}

#newJokeBtn {
    margin-top: 20px;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    font-size: 16px;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
end style.css

script.js:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const jokeText = document.getElementById('joke');
    const newJokeBtn = document.getElementById('newJokeBtn');

    const getJoke = () => {
        fetch('https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => jokeText.textContent = `${data.setup} ${data.punchline}`)
            .catch(error => console.error(error));
    }

    newJokeBtn.addEventListener('click', getJoke);
    getJoke();
});
```
end script.js

Note: The JavaScript code uses the Fetch API to get a random joke from the Official Joke API. The joke is then displayed on the page. When the "Get Another Joke" button is clicked, a new joke is fetched and displayed.===============================
