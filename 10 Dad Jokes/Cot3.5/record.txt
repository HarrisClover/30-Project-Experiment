I wanted to have a website that would automatically display a short joke in the middle of the page. Click the "Get Another Joke" button to toggle the display of a joke.Let's think step by step===============================
Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a website that automatically displays a short joke in the middle of the page:

Step 1: Set up the basic HTML structure
- Create a new HTML file and open it in a text editor.
- Add the basic HTML structure by including the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

Step 2: Add CSS styling
- Inside the `<head>` section, add a `<style>` tag to define the CSS styles for your website.
- Use CSS to center the content on the page, set the font styles, and customize the button's appearance.

Step 3: Create a container for the joke
- Inside the `<body>` section, create a `<div>` element to serve as the container for the joke.
- Apply CSS styles to center the container on the page and set its initial visibility to hidden.

Step 4: Add a button to toggle the joke display
- Inside the `<body>` section, create a `<button>` element with the text "Get Another Joke".
- Add an `onclick` attribute to the button and set it to a JavaScript function that will handle the display of the joke.

Step 5: Write JavaScript code
- Inside the `<script>` tag, write a JavaScript function that will handle the display of the joke.
- Create an array of short jokes that you want to display.
- Use JavaScript to randomly select a joke from the array and display it in the container.
- Toggle the visibility of the container when the button is clicked.

Step 6: Link the JavaScript code
- Add a `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag to link your JavaScript code to the HTML file.

Step 7: Save and test your website
- Save the HTML file with a .html extension.
- Open the file in a web browser to test if the joke is displayed and the button works as expected.

Remember to continuously test and make adjustments as needed to achieve the desired functionality and appearance of your website.===============================
