The application will be built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We will use the Fetch API to make requests to the Github API. 

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. `package.json`: This file will contain the project metadata and the list of dependencies required by the project.

2. `src/index.js`: This is the entry point of the application. It will render the main `App` component.

3. `src/App.js`: This is the main component of the application. It will contain the search bar and the user profile component.

4. `src/components/SearchBar.js`: This component will contain the input field and the search button.

5. `src/components/UserProfile.js`: This component will display the user's basic information and the list of repositories.

6. `src/components/Repository.js`: This component will display the information of a single repository.

7. `src/utils/api.js`: This file will contain the function to make requests to the Github API.

Now, let's start with the `package.json` file:
