As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

```python
import tkinter as tk
import requests

class GithubSearchApp(tk.Tk):

        super().__init__()
        self.title("Github User Search")

            self.result_label.config(text=user_data)
        else:
            self.result_label.config(text="User not found")
        
    def get_user_data(self, username):
        url = f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            user_data = response.json()
            return f"Name: {user_data['name']}\nBio: {user_data['bio']}"
        
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = GithubSearchApp()
    app.mainloop()
```

2. requirements.txt: This file will list the required packages for the application.

```
requests
```

Make sure to install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the application.

To run the application, execute the `main.py` file. It will open a GUI window where users can enter a Github username, click the search button, and view the user's basic information (name and bio) if found.

Note: This implementation uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the Github API.

2. requirements.txt: This file will list the required packages for the application.

```
requests
```

Make sure to install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the application.

To run the application, execute the `main.py` file. It will open a GUI window where users can enter a Github username, click the search button, and view the user's basic information (name and bio) if found.

Note: This implementation uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the Github API.

Here is a new customer's task: This front-end code implements a Github user search application where users can enter a Github username in the input field and view the user's basic information and repository list..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code looks good and implements the required functionality. It uses the tkinter library for creating the GUI and the requests library for making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.

To improve the code, you can add error handling for cases where the user enters an invalid username or there is a network error. Additionally, you can enhance the UI by displaying the repository list as well.

Here's an updated version of the code that includes error handling and displays the repository list:

In this updated version, I added a new Listbox widget to display the repository list. The `get_user_data` method now also returns the repository list. The `get_user_repos` method is responsible for fetching the repository list from the GitHub API.

Make sure to update the `requirements.txt` file to include any additional dependencies that were added, if necessary.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code is missing the import statement for the `tkinter` module. To fix this, add the line `import tkinter as tk` at the beginning of the `main.py` file.

<Instructions>
Add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

Once you have made this change, the code should be able to import the `tkinter` module successfully.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is missing the import statement for the `tkinter` module. To fix this, add the line `import tkinter as tk` at the beginning of the `main.py` file.

<Instructions>
Add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

Once you have made this change, the code should be able to import the `tkinter` module successfully."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the code is missing the implementation of the main functionality, i.e., the Github user search and displaying the user's basic information and repository list. Currently, the code only imports the `tkinter` module and includes a `requirements.txt` file.

<Suggestion>
To fix this, you need to implement the main functionality of the Github user search application. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   - `requests` module for making HTTP requests to the Github API.
   - `json` module for parsing the API response.

2. Create a Tkinter window:
   - Use the `tkinter.Tk()` function to create a new window.
   - Set the window title and dimensions.

3. Create the user interface elements:
   - Add a `tkinter.Label` to display a prompt for the Github username.
   - Add a `tkinter.Entry` to allow the user to enter the Github username.
   - Add a `tkinter.Button` to initiate the search.
   - Add a `tkinter.Text` widget to display the user's basic information and repository list.

4. Implement the search functionality:
   - Bind a function to the button's click event.
   - Inside the function, retrieve the entered username from the entry widget.
   - Make an HTTP GET request to the Github API using the `requests` module.
   - Parse the JSON response using the `json` module.
   - Extract the user's basic information and repository list from the response.
   - Update the text widget with the retrieved information.

5. Run the Tkinter event loop:
   - Use the `tkinter.mainloop()` function to start the event loop and display the window.

Make sure to add necessary comments throughout the code to explain the functionality and improve code readability.

Once you have implemented the above steps, please provide the updated code for further review.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, it seems that the only external dependency required for the project is the `requests` library. Therefore, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
requirements.txt
```
requests
```
This file specifies that the project requires the `requests` library, which can be installed using the `pip` package manager. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."
