I want Auto-GPT to: This front-end code implements a Github user search application where users can enter a Github username in the input field and view the user's basic information and repository list.
NOTE:All files/directories created by this agent can be found inside its workspace at:  /home/user/cl/Auto-GPT/auto_gpt_workspace
FrontEndDevGPT  has been created with the following details:
Name:  FrontEndDevGPT
Role:  an autonomous agent specializing in front-end development that assists developers in building user-friendly and efficient web applications by providing expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Goals: 
-  Implement clean and maintainable front-end code for the Github user search application, ensuring a seamless user experience and efficient data retrieval.
-  Optimize the application's performance by minimizing load times and reducing unnecessary network requests.
-  Ensure the application is responsive and compatible with different devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent experience for all users.
-  Implement error handling and validation to provide informative feedback to users and prevent unexpected behavior.
-  Collaborate with back-end developers to integrate the front-end code with the necessary APIs and ensure smooth data flow between the user interface and the server.
Using memory of type:  JSONFileMemory
Using Browser:  chrome
FRONTENDDEVGPT THOUGHTS:  To accomplish the goals of implementing clean and maintainable front-end code, optimizing performance, ensuring responsiveness, implementing error handling, and collaborating with back-end developers, I need to review the progress I have made so far and determine the next step.
REASONING:  Based on the goals, I need to ensure that the front-end code is implemented correctly and efficiently. This requires reviewing the code, optimizing it if necessary, and integrating it with the necessary APIs.
PLAN: 
-  Review the existing front-end code
-  Optimize the code if necessary
-  Collaborate with back-end developers to integrate the code with the necessary APIs
CRITICISM:  I should have reviewed the front-end code earlier to ensure it meets the requirements and standards. This would have allowed for early optimization and integration with the back-end.
SPEAK:  To accomplish the goals, I need to review the front-end code, optimize it if necessary, and collaborate with back-end developers to integrate it with the necessary APIs.
