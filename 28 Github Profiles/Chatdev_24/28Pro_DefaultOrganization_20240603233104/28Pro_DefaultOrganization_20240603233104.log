[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: This front-end code implements a Github user search  application where users can enter a Github username  in the input field and view the user basic information  and repository list. Web code (.html, .css, .js) is preferred..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "This front-end code implements a Github user search  application where users can enter a Github username  in the input field and view the user basic information  and repository list. Web code (.html, .css, .js) is preferred.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " JavaScript"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  JavaScript. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: This front-end code implements a Github user search  application where users can enter a Github username  in the input field and view the user basic information  and repository list. Web code (.html, .css, .js) is preferred..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To implement the Github user search application, we will need to create three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js. 

First, let's start with the index.html file. This file will contain the HTML structure of the application, including the input field, user information display area, and repository list display area.

index.html:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Github User Search</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Github User Search</h1>
        <input type="text" id="usernameInput" placeholder="Enter Github username">
        <button onclick="searchUser()">Search</button>
        <div id="userInfo"></div>
        <ul id="repoList"></ul>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, let's create the style.css file to define the visual appearance of the application.

style.css:

```css
.container {
    max-width: 600px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

h1 {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

input[type="text"] {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

button {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
}

#userInfo {
    margin-top: 20px;
}

#repoList {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
}

#repoList li {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

Finally, let's create the script.js file to handle the user search functionality and display the user information and repository list.

script.js:

```javascript
function searchUser() {
    var username = document.getElementById("usernameInput").value;
    var url = "https://api.github.com/users/" + username;

    fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            displayUserInfo(data);
            displayRepoList(username);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
            alert("Error occurred while fetching user data.");
        });
}

function displayUserInfo(user) {
    var userInfoDiv = document.getElementById("userInfo");
    userInfoDiv.innerHTML = `
        <h2>${user.name}</h2>
        <p><strong>Username:</strong> ${user.login}</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${user.location}</p>
        <p><strong>Followers:</strong> ${user.followers}</p>
        <p><strong>Following:</strong> ${user.following}</p>
    `;
}

function displayRepoList(username) {
    var url = "https://api.github.com/users/" + username + "/repos";

    fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            var repoList = document.getElementById("repoList");
            repoList.innerHTML = "";

            data.forEach(repo => {
                var li = document.createElement("li");
                li.textContent = repo.name;
                repoList.appendChild(li);
            });
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
            alert("Error occurred while fetching repository list.");
        });
}
```

With these three files, we have implemented the Github user search application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The index.html file provides the structure of the application, style.css defines the visual appearance, and script.js handles the user search functionality and data display.

}

function displayRepoList(username) {
    var url = "https://api.github.com/users/" + username + "/repos";

    fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            var repoList = document.getElementById("repoList");
            repoList.innerHTML = "";

            data.forEach(repo => {

                li.textContent = repo.name;
                repoList.appendChild(li);

        })
        .catch(error => {

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `displayUserInfo` function, the properties `name`, `login`, `location`, `followers`, and `following` are directly accessed from the `user` object without any null checks. This can lead to errors if any of these properties are not present in the response from the GitHub API.

To fix this issue, you can add null checks before accessing these properties. Here's an updated version of the `displayUserInfo` function with null checks:

```js
function displayUserInfo(user) {
    var userInfoDiv = document.getElementById("userInfo");
    userInfoDiv.innerHTML = `
        <h2>${user.name ? user.name : 'N/A'}</h2>
        <p><strong>Username:</strong> ${user.login ? user.login : 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${user.location ? user.location : 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Followers:</strong> ${user.followers ? user.followers : 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Following:</strong> ${user.following ? user.following : 'N/A'}</p>
    `;
}
```

With this change, if any of the properties are missing in the response, it will display "N/A" instead of throwing an error.

Please make this modification to ensure the code handles potential null values correctly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: This front-end code implements a Github user search  application where users can enter a Github username  in the input field and view the user basic information  and repository list. Web code (.html, .css, .js) is preferred..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below:

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `displayUserInfo` function, the properties `name`, `login`, `location`, `followers`, and `following` are directly accessed from the `user` object without any null checks. This can lead to errors if any of these properties are not present in the response from the GitHub API.

To fix this issue, you can add null checks before accessing these properties. Here's an updated version of the `displayUserInfo` function with null checks:

```js
function displayUserInfo(user) {
    var userInfoDiv = document.getElementById("userInfo");
    userInfoDiv.innerHTML = `
        <h2>${user.name ? user.name : 'N/A'}</h2>
        <p><strong>Username:</strong> ${user.login ? user.login : 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${user.location ? user.location : 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Followers:</strong> ${user.followers ? user.followers : 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Following:</strong> ${user.following ? user.following : 'N/A'}</p>
    `;
}
```

With this change, if any of the properties are missing in the response, it will display "N/A" instead of throwing an error.

Please make this modification to ensure the code handles potential null values correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed. In the `displayUserInfo` function, the properties `user.name`, `user.login`, `user.location`, `user.followers`, and `user.following` are accessed without checking if they exist. This can lead to errors if any of these properties are undefined.

To fix this, you can use the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value of "N/A" if the property is undefined. Here's the revised code for the `displayUserInfo` function:

```js
function displayUserInfo(user) {
    var userInfoDiv = document.getElementById("userInfo");
    userInfoDiv.innerHTML = `
        <h2>${user.name ?? 'N/A'}</h2>
        <p><strong>Username:</strong> ${user.login ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${user.location ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Followers:</strong> ${user.followers ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Following:</strong> ${user.following ?? 'N/A'}</p>
    `;
}
```

By using the nullish coalescing operator, the code will display "N/A" if any of the properties are undefined, ensuring that the user interface remains consistent.

Please make this change to ensure the code handles undefined properties correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed. In the `displayUserInfo` function, the properties `user.name`, `user.login`, `user.location`, `user.followers`, and `user.following` are accessed without checking if they exist. This can lead to errors if any of these properties are undefined.

To fix this, you can use the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value of "N/A" if the property is undefined. Here's the revised code for the `displayUserInfo` function:

```js
function displayUserInfo(user) {
    var userInfoDiv = document.getElementById("userInfo");
    userInfoDiv.innerHTML = `
        <h2>${user.name ?? 'N/A'}</h2>
        <p><strong>Username:</strong> ${user.login ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${user.location ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Followers:</strong> ${user.followers ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Following:</strong> ${user.following ?? 'N/A'}</p>
    `;
}
```

By using the nullish coalescing operator, the code will display "N/A" if any of the properties are undefined, ensuring that the user interface remains consistent.

Please make this change to ensure the code handles undefined properties correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: This front-end code implements a Github user search  application where users can enter a Github username  in the input field and view the user basic information  and repository list. Web code (.html, .css, .js) is preferred..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed. In the `displayUserInfo` function, the properties `name`, `login`, `location`, `followers`, and `following` are accessed directly from the `user` object without checking if they exist. This can lead to errors if any of these properties are undefined.

To fix this, you can use the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value of 'N/A' if the property is undefined. This will ensure that the code doesn't break if any of these properties are missing.

Here's the revised code for the `displayUserInfo` function:

```js
function displayUserInfo(user) {
    var userInfoDiv = document.getElementById("userInfo");
    userInfoDiv.innerHTML = `
        <h2>${user.name ?? 'N/A'}</h2>
        <p><strong>Username:</strong> ${user.login ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${user.location ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Followers:</strong> ${user.followers ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Following:</strong> ${user.following ?? 'N/A'}</p>
    `;
}
```

By using the nullish coalescing operator, the code will display 'N/A' if any of the properties are undefined, providing a more robust user experience.

Please make this change to ensure that the code handles undefined properties correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed. In the `displayUserInfo` function, the properties `name`, `login`, `location`, `followers`, and `following` are accessed directly from the `user` object without checking if they exist. This can lead to errors if any of these properties are undefined.

To fix this, you can use the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value of 'N/A' if the property is undefined. This will ensure that the code doesn't break if any of these properties are missing.

Here's the revised code for the `displayUserInfo` function:

```js
function displayUserInfo(user) {
    var userInfoDiv = document.getElementById("userInfo");
    userInfoDiv.innerHTML = `
        <h2>${user.name ?? 'N/A'}</h2>
        <p><strong>Username:</strong> ${user.login ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${user.location ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Followers:</strong> ${user.followers ?? 'N/A'}</p>
        <p><strong>Following:</strong> ${user.following ?? 'N/A'}</p>
    `;
}
```

By using the nullish coalescing operator, the code will display 'N/A' if any of the properties are undefined, providing a more robust user experience.

Please make this change to ensure that the code handles undefined properties correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: This front-end code implements a Github user search  application where users can enter a Github username  in the input field and view the user basic information  and repository list. Web code (.html, .css, .js) is preferred..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Since the provided code is written in JavaScript and HTML, there is no need for a requirements.txt file. The requirements.txt file is specific to Python projects and is used to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

In JavaScript, dependencies are typically managed using package.json and package-lock.json files, which are used by package managers like npm or yarn. These files specify the dependencies and their versions needed for the project.

If you are using any specific JavaScript libraries or frameworks in your project, you can include them in the package.json file. For example, if you are using a library like Axios for making HTTP requests, you can add it as a dependency in the package.json file like this:

package.json

```json
{
  "name": "github-user-search",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.21.1"
  }
}
```

In this example, Axios is added as a dependency with version "^0.21.1", which means any version greater than or equal to 0.21.1 will be installed.

To install the dependencies specified in the package.json file, you can run the following command in the project directory:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

So, in summary, for a JavaScript project like the one you provided, you don't need a requirements.txt file. Instead, you can use the package.json file to specify the JavaScript dependencies required for the project.

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
