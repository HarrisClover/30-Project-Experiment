Sure, let's create a simple currency converter webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will use the free API from https://exchangerate-api.com for getting the conversion rates.

Here are the files we will need:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of our webpage.
2. style.css: This CSS file will contain the styles for our webpage.
3. script.js: This JavaScript file will contain the logic for fetching the conversion rates and performing the currency conversion.
4. package.json: This file will contain the dependencies for our project.

Let's start with the HTML file:

index.html
