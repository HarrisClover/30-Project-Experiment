To achieve this, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will create a simple web page with a placeholder text. The placeholder text will have a gradient background and moving gradient stripes animation using CSS. We will use JavaScript to simulate the loading of actual data and replace the placeholder text with the actual data once it's loaded.

Here are the files we will need:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of our web page.

2. styles.css: This is the CSS file that will contain all the styles for our web page, including the gradient background and moving gradient stripes animation.

3. script.js: This is the JavaScript file that will simulate the loading of actual data and replace the placeholder text with the actual data once it's loaded.

Let's start with the HTML file:

index.html
