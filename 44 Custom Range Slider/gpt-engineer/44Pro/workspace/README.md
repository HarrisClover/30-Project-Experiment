To implement this task, we will use Python with Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. We will create a simple web application where the user can adjust a slider and the value will be sent to the server and stored.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application and routes.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML file that will contain the slider and JavaScript code to send the slider value to the server.

3. `static/main.css`: This is the CSS file that will contain the styles for our slider.

4. `static/main.js`: This is the JavaScript file that will contain the code to send the slider value to the server when it changes.

5. `requirements.txt`: This file will contain the Python dependencies for our application.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
