A website with questions about computers. Four options for each question are displayed in the middle of the web page, and the user can select an answer to submit.Let's think step by step===============================
1. Website Design: The website should have a clean and user-friendly design. The color scheme should be pleasing to the eye and the font should be easy to read. The layout should be simple and intuitive, with clear navigation menus and buttons.

2. Question Display: The questions about computers should be displayed in the middle of the web page. Each question should be clearly visible and easy to read. The questions could be categorized based on different topics like hardware, software, programming, etc.

3. Answer Options: For each question, four answer options should be provided. These options should be displayed below the question. The options should be clearly distinguishable from each other and should be easy to select.

4. Answer Submission: The user should be able to select an answer by clicking on it. Once an answer is selected, a 'Submit' button should appear. Clicking on this button should submit the answer. The website should then display whether the answer was correct or incorrect, and provide the correct answer if the user was wrong.

5. Progress Tracking: The website should track the user's progress. It could display the number of questions answered correctly and incorrectly, and the total number of questions answered.

6. User Account: The website could also have a feature where users can create an account to save their progress. This way, they can continue answering questions from where they left off the next time they visit the website.

7. Feedback: There should be a feedback mechanism where users can report any issues with the questions or the website, or suggest improvements.

8. Updates: The website should be regularly updated with new questions to keep users engaged and encourage them to keep learning.

9. Accessibility: The website should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This could include features like text-to-speech for visually impaired users, and keyboard navigation for those who can't use a mouse.

10. Security: The website should be secure to protect users' personal information, especially if they are creating an account. This could include measures like encryption and secure login procedures.===============================

#quiz-container {
    width: 60%;
    margin: auto;
    text-align: center;
}

#question-container, #options-container {
    margin-bottom: 20px;

    padding: 10px 20px;
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: #45a049;
}
```
end style.css

script.js:
```javascript
// This is a placeholder for your JavaScript code. 
// You would need to implement the logic for displaying questions, handling answer submission, tracking progress, etc.

document.getElementById('submit-button').addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Handle answer submission
});
```
end script.js

Please note that this is a very basic structure. The actual implementation would require a backend to store the questions and handle user accounts, as well as more complex JavaScript to handle the quiz functionality.===============================
