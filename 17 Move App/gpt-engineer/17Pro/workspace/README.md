To implement this task, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will also use Bootstrap for styling and layout, and jQuery for handling events and making AJAX requests. 

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the user interface.

2. style.css: This file will contain all the custom CSS styles.

3. script.js: This file will contain all the JavaScript code for handling events and making AJAX requests.

4. package.json: This file will contain all the project dependencies.

5. README.md: This file will contain instructions on how to run the project.

Let's start with the entry point file:

index.html
