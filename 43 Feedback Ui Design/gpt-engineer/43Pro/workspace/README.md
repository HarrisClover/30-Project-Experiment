To implement this, we will need a web application with a front-end and a back-end. The front-end will be responsible for displaying the options to the user and collecting their feedback. The back-end will process the feedback and store it in a database.

Here is a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. Front-end: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
2. Back-end: Python Flask web server to handle HTTP requests and responses.
3. Database: SQLite to store the feedback data.

Let's start with the entry point of our application, the Python Flask server.
