# Kinetic Loader Web Page

## Introduction

The Kinetic Loader Web Page is a simple web page that displays a dynamic loading symbol in the middle. The dynamic symbol consists of two triangles that constantly invert their colors, creating a visually appealing loading effect.

## Installation

To use the Kinetic Loader Web Page, you need to have Python and the Tkinter library installed on your system. Follow the steps below to install the necessary dependencies:

1. Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Install Tkinter: Tkinter is a standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. It should be included with your Python installation. If you're not sure whether Tkinter is installed, you can check by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   python -m tkinter
   ```

   If Tkinter is installed, a blank window should appear. If not, you can install Tkinter using the following command:

   ```
   pip install tkinter
   ```

## Usage

Once you have Python and Tkinter installed, you can use the Kinetic Loader Web Page by following these steps:

1. Create a new Python file and copy the code provided in the `main.py` file.

2. Save the Python file with a `.py` extension, for example, `kinetic_loader.py`.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.

4. Run the Python file using the following command:

   ```
   python kinetic_loader.py
   ```

5. A new window titled "Kinetic Loader" should appear, displaying the dynamic loading symbol.

## Customization

If you want to customize the appearance or behavior of the Kinetic Loader Web Page, you can modify the code in the `main.py` file. Here are a few suggestions:

- Change the size of the canvas: You can modify the `width` and `height` parameters when creating the canvas to change its size.

- Adjust the position of the triangles: You can modify the coordinates passed to the `create_polygon` method to change the position of the triangles.

- Modify the colors: You can change the `fill` parameter when creating the triangles to use different colors.

- Adjust the animation speed: You can modify the `after` method call to change the delay between each animation frame.

Feel free to experiment with the code and make it your own!
