We will create three files: `index.html` for the structure of the webpage, `styles.css` for the styling of the webpage and the loading symbol, and `script.js` for the dynamic behavior of the loading symbol.\n\nLet's start with the HTML file:\n\nindex.html\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Loading Page</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"loader\">\n        <div class=\"triangle\"></div>\n        <div class=\"triangle\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis HTML file sets up the structure of the webpage. It includes a `div` with the id `loader`, which contains two `div` elements with the class `triangle`. These `div` elements will be used to create the two triangles of the loading symbol.\n\nNext, let's create the CSS file:\n\nstyles.css\n```css\nbody {\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    height: 100vh;\n    background: #f3f3f3;\n}\n\n#loader {\n    position: relative;\n    width: 100px;\n    height: 100px;\n}\n\n.triangle {\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 0;\n    height: 0;\n    border-left: 50px solid transparent;\n    border-right: 50px solid transparent;\n}\n\n.triangle:first-child {\n    border-bottom: 100px solid black;\n    animation: flip 2s infinite;\n}\n\n.triangle:last-child {\n    border-top: 100px solid black;\n    animation: flip 2s infinite reverse;\n}\n\n@keyframes flip {\n    0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }\n    100% { transform: rotate(180deg); }\n}\n```\n\nThis CSS file styles the webpage and the loading symbol. It uses Flexbox to center the loading symbol on the page. The `triangle` class is used to create the two triangles of the loading symbol using CSS borders. The `flip` animation is used to rotate the triangles.\n\nFinally, let's create the JavaScript file:\n\nscript.js\n```javascript\n// No JavaScript code is needed as the animation is handled by CSS\n```\n\nIn this case, no JavaScript code is needed as the animation of the loading symbol is handled entirely by CSS.\n\nThis concludes a fully working implementation.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "human", "example": false}}, {"type": "AIMessageChunk", "data": {"content": "Since the codebase provided is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project, there are no dependencies to install.
