# Random Picture Table Web Page

To meet your requirements, I have developed a web page that can randomly display pictures in the form of a table. Below is a detailed user manual to help you understand how to use the software.

## Main Functions

The main function of the web page is to display a table with randomly selected pictures. Each time you refresh the page, a new picture will be displayed in the table.

## Installation

1. Download the provided files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
2. Place the files in a directory on your computer.

## Usage

To use the web page, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Each time you refresh the page, a new picture will be randomly selected and displayed in the table.

## Customization

If you want to customize the pictures displayed in the table, you can modify the `pictures` array in the `script.js` file. Simply replace the URLs in the array with the URLs of your desired pictures.

```js
// script.js
// Array of picture URLs
var pictures = [
    "https://example.com/picture1.jpg",
    "https://example.com/picture2.jpg",
    "https://example.com/picture3.jpg",
    // Add more picture URLs as needed
];
```
