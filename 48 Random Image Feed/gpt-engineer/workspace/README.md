To achieve this, we will use Python with Flask as the web framework and Jinja2 for the templating engine. We will also use Bootstrap for the frontend to make the table look nice.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application and the route to our webpage.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the Jinja2 template for our webpage. It will contain the HTML and Jinja2 code to display the pictures in a table.

3. `static/images/`: This directory will contain the images that we want to display.

4. `requirements.txt`: This file will contain all the Python dependencies that our application needs.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
