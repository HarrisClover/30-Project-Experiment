To achieve this, we will use Python's Flask framework to create a simple web application. We will also use HTML and CSS for the frontend. The pictures will be stored in a static folder in the project directory.

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. `app.py`: This is the main Python script that runs the Flask application.
2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML file that creates the webpage.
3. `static/css/styles.css`: This is the CSS file that styles the webpage.
4. `static/images/`: This is the directory where the images are stored.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
