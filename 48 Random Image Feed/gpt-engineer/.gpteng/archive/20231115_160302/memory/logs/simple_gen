We will also use HTML and CSS for the frontend. The pictures will be stored in a static folder in the project directory.\n\nHere are the core files and their purposes:\n\n1. `app.py`: This is the main Python script that runs the Flask application.\n2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML file that creates the webpage.\n3. `static/css/styles.css`: This is the CSS file that styles the webpage.\n4. `static/images/`: This is the directory where the images are stored.\n\nLet's start with the `app.py` file:\n\napp.py\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\nimport os\nimport random\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    # Get list of images\n    image_names = os.listdir('static/images')\n    # Randomly shuffle the images\n    random.shuffle(image_names)\n    # Render the index.html template, passing in the images\n    return render_template('index.html', image_names=image_names)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nNext, let's create the `index.html` file:\n\ntemplates/index.html\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Random Image Display</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='css/styles.css') }}\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <table>\n        {% for image in image_names %}\n        <tr>\n            <td><img src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='images/' + image) }}\" alt=\"Image\"></td>\n        </tr>\n        {% endfor %}\n    </table>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNow, let's create the `styles.css` file:\n\nstatic/css/styles.css\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n\ntable {\n    margin: auto;\n    width: 50%;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n}\n\ntd {\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n\nimg {\n    width: 100%;\n    height: auto;\n}\n```\n\nFinally, you need to place your images in the `static/images/` directory.\n\nTo run the application, you need to install Flask. You can do this by creating a `requirements.txt` file:\n\nrequirements.txt\n```\nFlask==1.1.2\n```\n\nThen, you can install Flask using pip:\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nTo run the application, use the following command:\n\n```\npython app.py\n```\n\nThis concludes a fully working implementation.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "AIMessageChunk", "example": false}}]
