It will contain the Flask application and the route to our web page.\n\n2. `templates/index.html`: This is the Jinja2 template for our web page. It will contain the HTML and Jinja2 code to display the pictures in a table.\n\n3. `static/images/`: This directory will contain the images that we want to display.\n\n4. `requirements.txt`: This file will contain the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the application to run.\n\nLet's start with the `app.py` file:\n\napp.py\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\nimport os\nimport random\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    # Get a list of all the image files in the static/images directory\n    image_files = os.listdir('static/images')\n\n    # Randomly shuffle the list of image files\n    random.shuffle(image_files)\n\n    # Render the index.html template, passing in the image_files\n    return render_template('index.html', image_files=image_files)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nNext, let's create the `index.html` template:\n\ntemplates/index.html\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Random Image Display</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h1 class=\"mt-5\">Random Image Display</h1>\n        <table class=\"table mt-5\">\n            <tbody>\n                {% for image_file in image_files %}\n                <tr>\n                    <td>\n                        <img src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='images/' + image_file) }}\" alt=\"Image\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                {% endfor %}\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nFinally, let's create the `requirements.txt` file:\n\nrequirements.txt\n```\nFlask==1.1.2\n```\n\nTo run the application, first install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run `python app.py`.
