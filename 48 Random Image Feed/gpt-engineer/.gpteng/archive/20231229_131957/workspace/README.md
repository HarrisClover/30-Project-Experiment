To achieve this, we will use Python with Flask as the web framework and Jinja2 for the template engine. We will also use Bootstrap to style the table. 

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application and the route to our web page.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the Jinja2 template for our web page. It will contain the HTML and Jinja2 code to display the pictures in a table.

3. `static/images/`: This directory will contain the images that we want to display.

4. `requirements.txt`: This file will contain the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the application to run.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
