According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "I need a web page with a Show notifications button on it. If I click the Show notifications button to show the latest messages on the screen, make sure the messages are displayed in the correct chronological order.".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

```

notifications.py

```python
'''
This file contains the Notifications class that handles the retrieval and ordering of messages.
'''

class Notifications:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = []
        
    def get_notifications(self):
        sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages, key=lambda x: x["timestamp"])
        return [message["content"] for message in sorted_messages]
    
    def add_notification(self, content, timestamp):
        self.messages.append({"content": content, "timestamp": timestamp})
```

In the above code, we have the main.py file which serves as the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the `App` class, which is a tkinter-based GUI application. The `App` class has a button to show notifications and a label to display the messages.

The notifications.py file contains the `Notifications` class that handles the retrieval and ordering of messages. It has a list to store the messages and provides methods to add new notifications and retrieve them in the correct chronological order.

The `get_notifications` method sorts the messages based on the timestamp and returns a list of message contents. The `add_notification` method allows adding new notifications to the list.

This code ensures that when the "Show Notifications" button is clicked, the latest messages are displayed in the correct chronological order on the GUI.

notifications.py

```python
'''
This file contains the Notifications class that handles the retrieval and ordering of messages.
'''

class Notifications:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = []
        
    def get_notifications(self):
        sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages, key=lambda x: x["timestamp"])
        return [message["content"] for message in sorted_messages]
    
    def add_notification(self, content, timestamp):
        self.messages.append({"content": content, "timestamp": timestamp})
```

In the above code, we have the main.py file which serves as the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the `App` class, which is a tkinter-based GUI application. The `App` class has a button to show notifications and a label to display the messages.

The notifications.py file contains the `Notifications` class that handles the retrieval and ordering of messages. It has a list to store the messages and provides methods to add new notifications and retrieve them in the correct chronological order.

The `get_notifications` method sorts the messages based on the timestamp and returns a list of message contents. The `add_notification` method allows adding new notifications to the list.

This code ensures that when the "Show Notifications" button is clicked, the latest messages are displayed in the correct chronological order on the GUI.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statement for the tkinter module in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will ensure that the tkinter module is imported and available for use in the application.

Additionally, the code is missing the implementation of the `add_notification` method in the Notifications class. To fix this, add the following code to the notifications.py file:

```python
def add_notification(self, content, timestamp):
    self.messages.append({"content": content, "timestamp": timestamp})
```

This method will allow new notifications to be added to the list of messages.

Once these changes are made, the code should be able to run without any errors and display the notifications in the correct chronological order when the "Show Notifications" button is clicked.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statement for the tkinter module in the main.py file. This will cause an error when trying to create the App object.

To fix this, add the following line at the top of the main.py file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will import the tkinter module and allow the App class to be created without any errors.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the GUI and the functionality to display the notifications when the "Show notifications" button is clicked. To fix this, you need to add the necessary code to create the GUI and handle the button click event.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to achieve the desired functionality:

main.py
```python
import tkinter as tk
from notifications import Notifications

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        self.notifications = Notifications()

        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Notifications")

        self.label = tk.Label(self.root, text="")
        self.label.pack()

        self.button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Show notifications", command=self.show_notifications)
        self.button.pack()

    def show_notifications(self):
        notifications = self.notifications.get_notifications()
        self.label.config(text="\n".join(notifications))

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = App()
    app.run()
```

notifications.py remains the same.

This code creates a simple GUI using tkinter. It initializes an instance of the Notifications class and binds the `show_notifications` method to the button's command. When the button is clicked, it retrieves the notifications from the Notifications instance and displays them in the label.

You can run the `main.py` file to see the web page with the "Show notifications" button. When you click the button, the latest messages will be displayed in the correct chronological order.

Please make the necessary modifications to the code and let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the GUI and the functionality to display the notifications when the "Show notifications" button is clicked. To fix this, you need to add the necessary code to create the GUI and handle the button click event.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to achieve the desired functionality:

main.py
```python
import tkinter as tk
from notifications import Notifications

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        self.notifications = Notifications()

        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Notifications")

        self.label = tk.Label(self.root, text="")
        self.label.pack()

        self.button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Show notifications", command=self.show_notifications)
        self.button.pack()

    def show_notifications(self):
        notifications = self.notifications.get_notifications()
        self.label.config(text="\n".join(notifications))

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = App()
    app.run()
```

notifications.py remains the same.

This code creates a simple GUI using tkinter. It initializes an instance of the Notifications class and binds the `show_notifications` method to the button's command. When the button is clicked, it retrieves the notifications from the Notifications instance and displays them in the label.

You can run the `main.py` file to see the web page with the "Show notifications" button. When you click the button, the latest messages will be displayed in the correct chronological order.

Please make the necessary modifications to the code and let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.
