To achieve this, we will use Flask, a Python micro web framework, and JavaScript for handling button click events and displaying notifications. We will also use HTML and CSS for the webpage structure and styling.

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. `app.py`: This is the main Flask application file. It will contain the route for our webpage and an API endpoint to fetch the notifications.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML file that will contain the structure of our webpage. It will have a button to show notifications and a container to display the notifications.

3. `static/js/main.js`: This is the JavaScript file that will handle the button click event, fetch the notifications from the server, and display them on the webpage.

4. `static/css/main.css`: This is the CSS file that will contain the styles for our webpage.

5. `requirements.txt`: This file will contain all the Python dependencies required for our application.

Let's start with the `requirements.txt` file:
