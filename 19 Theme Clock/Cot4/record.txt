There is a dynamic circular clock in the middle of the page. The time is displayed under the clock. It can also switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode.Let's think step by step===============================
Step 1: Designing the Clock

The first step is to design the clock. It should be circular and placed in the middle of the page. The clock should have an hour hand, a minute hand, and a second hand. The numbers 1 to 12 should be displayed around the clock.

Step 2: Displaying the Time

The current time should be displayed under the clock. This can be done by using JavaScript to get the current time and then displaying it on the page. The time should be updated every second so that it stays accurate.

Step 3: Adding Dark Mode and Light Mode

The page should have a button that allows the user to switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode. In Dark Mode, the background of the page should be dark and the text and clock should be light. In Light Mode, the background should be light and the text and clock should be dark. This can be done by using CSS to change the colors of the elements on the page.

Step 4: Making the Clock Dynamic

The clock should be dynamic, meaning that the hands of the clock move to show the current time. This can be done by using JavaScript to get the current time and then using CSS to rotate the hands of the clock to the correct positions.

Step 5: Testing and Debugging

The final step is to test the clock to make sure it works correctly. This includes checking that the time is displayed correctly, the hands of the clock move correctly, and the Dark Mode and Light Mode work correctly. Any bugs that are found should be fixed.===============================
