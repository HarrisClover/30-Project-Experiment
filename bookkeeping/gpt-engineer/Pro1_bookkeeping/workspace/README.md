Sure, I will create a simple bookkeeping assistant website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will have a form to input transactions (income and expenses), a table to display the transactions, and a summary section to show the total income, total expenses, and balance.

Here are the files we will need:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website.
2. styles.css: This file will contain all the CSS styles for the website.
3. script.js: This file will contain all the JavaScript code for the website.

Let's start with the HTML file:

index.html
