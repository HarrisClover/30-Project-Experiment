To implement this feature, we will need to create several files:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of our webpage.
2. style.css: This file will contain all the CSS styles that will be applied to our webpage.
3. script.js: This file will contain all the JavaScript code that will handle the user interactions and update the tracker.
4. package.json: This file will contain all the dependencies of our project.

Let's start with the entry point file:

index.html
