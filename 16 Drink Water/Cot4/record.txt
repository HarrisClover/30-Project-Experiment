A task would be to develop a feature that allows users to log their water consumption by selecting the glass icons, and then visually update the tracker to reflect their current progress towards the daily goal.Let's think step by step===============================
1. Requirement Gathering: Understand the user requirements and the purpose of the feature. The feature should be able to track the user's daily water consumption and show their progress towards their daily goal.

2. Design: Sketch the design of the feature. The design should include glass icons that users can select to log their water consumption. It should also include a visual tracker that updates to show the user's progress towards their daily goal.

3. Development: Start the development process. This involves coding the feature according to the design and requirements. The feature should be able to accurately track the user's water consumption and update the visual tracker accordingly.

4. Testing: After the development process, the feature should be tested to ensure it works as expected. This involves checking if the feature accurately logs the user's water consumption and updates the visual tracker correctly.

5. Deployment: Once the feature has been tested and approved, it can be deployed for users to use. This involves integrating the feature into the existing system and making sure it works seamlessly with other features.

6. User Feedback: After deployment, gather user feedback to understand if the feature is meeting their needs and if there are any issues that need to be addressed.

7. Iteration: Based on the user feedback, make necessary changes and improvements to the feature. This could involve tweaking the design, improving the accuracy of the tracking, or making the visual tracker more intuitive.

8. Maintenance: Regularly update and maintain the feature to ensure it continues to meet user needs and works effectively. This could involve fixing bugs, improving performance, or adding new functionalities.===============================
