Let's start by creating the project structure. We will have the following files:

- main.py: This is the entry point of our application.
- password_generator.py: This file will contain the logic for generating the password.
- requirements.txt: This file will contain the list of dependencies required for our application.

Now, let's start writing the code for each file.

src/main.py
