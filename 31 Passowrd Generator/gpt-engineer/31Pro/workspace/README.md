Let's start with the project structure. We will have the following files:

- `main.py`: This is the entry point of our application.
- `password_generator.py`: This file will contain the logic for generating the password.
- `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that our project needs.

Now, let's start with the content of each file.
