To create a Notes App in Python, we will need several components. Here is a list of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. Note class: This class will represent a single note. It will have properties like title, content, and creation date.

2. NotesDatabase class: This class will handle all interactions with the database. It will have methods for adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving notes.

3. NotesApp class: This class will be the main application class. It will use the NotesDatabase class to interact with the database and will provide a user interface for the user to interact with their notes.

4. main function: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will create an instance of the NotesApp class and start the application.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
