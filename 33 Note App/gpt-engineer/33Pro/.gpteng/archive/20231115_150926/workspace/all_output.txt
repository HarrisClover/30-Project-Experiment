To create a Notes App in Python, we will need several components. Here is a list of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. Note class: This class will represent a single note. It will have properties like title, content, and creation date.

2. NotesDatabase class: This class will handle all interactions with the database. It will have methods for adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving notes.

3. NotesApp class: This class will be the main application class. It will use the NotesDatabase class to interact with the database and will provide a user interface for the user to interact with their notes.

4. main function: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will create an instance of the NotesApp class and start the application.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

src/main.py
```python
from notes_app import NotesApp

def main():
    app = NotesApp()
    app.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

src/notes_app.py
```python
from notes_database import NotesDatabase

class NotesApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = NotesDatabase()

    def run(self):
        # TODO: Implement the main application loop
        pass
```

src/notes_database.py
```python
from note import Note
import sqlite3

class NotesDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect('notes.db')
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        self.cursor.execute('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes
            (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, content TEXT, date TEXT)
        ''')

    def add_note(self, note):
        # TODO: Implement adding a note to the database
        pass

    def update_note(self, note):
        # TODO: Implement updating a note in the database
        pass

    def delete_note(self, note_id):
        # TODO: Implement deleting a note from the database
        pass

    def get_notes(self):
        # TODO: Implement retrieving all notes from the database
        pass
```

src/note.py
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class Note:
    id: int
    title: str
    content: str
    date: datetime
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
