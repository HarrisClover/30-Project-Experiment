Sure, let's create a simple Notes App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app will allow users to add, delete, and view notes.

Here are the files we'll need:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of our app.
2. styles.css: This file will contain all the CSS styles for our app.
3. script.js: This file will contain all the JavaScript code for our app.

Let's start with the HTML file:

index.html
