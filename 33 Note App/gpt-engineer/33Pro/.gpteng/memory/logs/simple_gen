Here's a high-level overview of the architecture:\n\n1. `Note` class: This class will represent a single note. It will have properties like `title`, `content`, and `created_at`.\n\n2. `Notebook` class: This class will represent a collection of notes. It will have methods to add, remove, and search for notes.\n\n3. `App` class: This class will be the main entry point of the application. It will handle user input and output, and it will use a `Notebook` instance to perform operations on notes.\n\n4. `main` function: This function will create an instance of the `App` class and start the application.\n\nNow, let's start with the implementation.
