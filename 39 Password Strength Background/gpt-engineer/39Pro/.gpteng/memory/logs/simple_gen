Please note that you need to replace 'background.jpg' in the CSS file with the actual path to your background image. The JavaScript function `checkPasswordStrength` checks the strength of the password and adjusts the blur of the background image accordingly. The stronger the password, the less the blur.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "AIMessageChunk", "example": false}}]
