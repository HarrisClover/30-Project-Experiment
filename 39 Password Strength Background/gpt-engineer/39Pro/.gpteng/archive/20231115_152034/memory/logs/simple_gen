No placeholders.\n\n\nYou will start with the \"entrypoint\" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.\n\nFollow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.\nMake sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.\nEnsure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\nInclude module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.\nBefore you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.\n\nWhen you are done, write finish with \"this concludes a fully working implementation\".\n\nUseful to know:\nAlmost always put different classes in different files.\nAlways use the programming language the user asks for.\nFor Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.\nFor NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.\nAlways add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.\nAdd comments explaining very complex bits of logic.\nAlways follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.\n\n\nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "system"}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "A password input interface, the blurring degree of the background will change according to the strength of the password (the simpler, the clearer)", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "human", "example": false}}, {"type": "AIMessageChunk", "data": {"content": "This task can be achieved using Python's Tkinter library for GUI and re (Regular Expressions) for password strength checking.
