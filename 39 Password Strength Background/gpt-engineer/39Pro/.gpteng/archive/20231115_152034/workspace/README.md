This task can be achieved using Python's Tkinter library for GUI and re (Regular Expressions) for password strength checking. The PIL (Python Imaging Library) library will be used for image processing.

Here are the core classes and functions that will be necessary:

1. `PasswordStrengthChecker`: This class will contain methods to check the strength of the password.
2. `check_strength`: This method will check the strength of the password.
3. `PasswordInputInterface`: This class will create the GUI interface.
4. `update_blur`: This method will update the blur of the background image based on the password strength.

Here is the implementation:
