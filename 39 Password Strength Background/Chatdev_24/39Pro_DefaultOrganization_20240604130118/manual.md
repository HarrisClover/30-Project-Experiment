# Password Input Interface

The Password Input Interface is a web-based interface that allows users to input a password and provides visual feedback on the strength of the password. The blurring degree of the background changes according to the strength of the password, with simpler passwords resulting in a clearer background.

## Installation

To use the Password Input Interface, follow these steps:

1. Download the code files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
2. Place the files in the desired directory on your web server.

## Usage

To use the Password Input Interface, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. You will see a password input field labeled "Password".
3. Enter your desired password in the input field.
4. As you type, the background blurring degree will change based on the strength of the password.
5. The password strength is determined based on the following criteria:
   - Length of the password (8 or more characters)
   - Presence of lowercase letters
   - Presence of uppercase letters
   - Presence of numbers
   - Presence of special characters ($, @, #, &, !)
6. The background blurring degree will change as follows:
   - Weak password: Clear background
   - Medium password: Partially blurred background
   - Strong password: Fully blurred background
7. The password strength label will also update accordingly.

## Example

Here is an example of how the Password Input Interface works:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the password "password123".
3. The background blurring degree will be clear, indicating a weak password.
4. The password strength label will display "Weak".
5. Now, enter the password "Password123!".
6. The background blurring degree will become partially blurred, indicating a medium password.
7. The password strength label will display "Medium".
8. Finally, enter the password "StrongPassword123!".
9. The background blurring degree will become fully blurred, indicating a strong password.
10. The password strength label will display "Strong".
