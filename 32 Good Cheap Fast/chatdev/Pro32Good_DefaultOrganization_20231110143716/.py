This will allow the `messagebox` class to be used in the `ProjectTrianglePage` class.
Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to explain the purpose of each method in the `ProjectTrianglePage` class.
Once you make these changes, the code should be ready for execution.
Instructions:
1. Add the import statement `from tkinter import messagebox` at the beginning of the code.
2. Add comments to explain the purpose of each method in the `ProjectTrianglePage` class.
3. Test the code to ensure it functions as expected.
