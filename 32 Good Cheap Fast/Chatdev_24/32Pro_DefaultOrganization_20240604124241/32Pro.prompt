The task is to generate a web page that demonstrates the three main goals of project management - good quality, cheap cost and fast time. These three main goals correspond to three sliding buttons. I can select both of the slide buttons at the same time. But there is no way to select three slide buttons at the same time. Web code (.html, .css, .js) is preferred.
