# ChatDev - Task Solution

## Introduction
Thank you for choosing ChatDev for your project management web page development. As the Chief Product Officer, I have reviewed your requirements and developed a solution that meets your needs. 

## Solution Overview
The solution consists of three main files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. The `index.html` file contains the structure of the web page, the `style.css` file contains the styling, and the `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code to handle the functionality of the sliding buttons.

## Installation
To use the solution, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Inside the project directory, create three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
3. Copy the code provided for each file into their respective files.
4. Save the files.

## Usage
To use the project management web page, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. You will see three sliding buttons labeled "Good Quality", "Cheap Cost", and "Fast Time".
3. You can slide each button to select the desired level for each goal.
4. If you try to select all three buttons at the same time, the third button will be disabled.
5. The result of your selection will be displayed below the sliding buttons.

## Example
Here is an example of how to use the project management web page:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Slide the "Good Quality" button to the desired level, e.g., 0.8.
3. Slide the "Cheap Cost" button to the desired level, e.g., 0.5.
4. The "Fast Time" button will be disabled since you have already selected two goals.
5. The result will be displayed as "You can select any combination of two goals."

## Dependencies
The solution does not require any external dependencies. It is a standalone web page that can be opened in any modern web browser.

## Conclusion
I hope this solution meets your requirements for the project management web page. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for choosing ChatDev, and I look forward to working with you on future projects.
