The task is to generate a web page that demonstrates the three main goals of project management - good quality, cheap cost and fast time. These three main goals correspond to three sliding buttons. I can select both of the slide buttons at the same time. But there is no way to select three slide buttons at the same time.Let's think step by step===============================
Step 1: Design the layout of the web page
- Start by creating a basic layout for the web page using HTML and CSS.
- Divide the page into three sections, one for each goal: good quality, cheap cost, and fast time.
- Add sliding buttons for each goal using HTML range input elements or any other suitable UI component.

Step 2: Implement the sliding buttons
- Use JavaScript to handle the sliding buttons' functionality.
- Assign unique IDs to each sliding button element.
- Add event listeners to the sliding buttons to detect changes in their values.
- When a sliding button is moved, update its corresponding goal's value and adjust the other goals accordingly.

Step 3: Handle the logic for selecting multiple goals
- Create a JavaScript function that checks the values of all three sliding buttons.
- If two sliding buttons have their values set to the maximum, disable the third sliding button to prevent selecting all three at the same time.
- Update the UI to reflect the disabled state of the third sliding button.

Step 4: Update the UI based on the selected goals
- Add HTML elements or CSS styles to visually represent the selected goals.
- For example, change the color or background of the goal sections based on the selected goals.
- Display a message or icon indicating the selected goals.

Step 5: Test and refine the web page
- Test the web page by interacting with the sliding buttons and verifying that the selected goals are correctly reflected.
- Make any necessary adjustments to the code or design to improve the user experience.
- Test the web page on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.

Step 6: Add additional features or enhancements (optional)
- Consider adding additional features, such as a submit button to save the selected goals or a reset button to clear the selections.
- Enhance the UI with animations or transitions to make the web page more engaging.
- Implement any other desired functionalities or improvements based on the project requirements.

Remember to document your code and provide clear instructions for users on how to interact with the sliding buttons and understand the selected goals.===============================
