To implement this feature, we will need a web application with a front-end and a back-end. The front-end will be responsible for displaying the list of online users and providing a search field for the user to enter a name or location. The back-end will be responsible for maintaining the list of online users and filtering it based on the search criteria.

We will use Flask for the back-end and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. We will also use AJAX to make asynchronous requests from the front-end to the back-end.

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the Flask application and defines the routes.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the main page of the application. It displays the list of online users and provides a search field for the user to enter a name or location.

3. `static/js/main.js`: This is the main JavaScript file. It handles the AJAX requests to the back-end and updates the list of online users based on the search criteria.

4. `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the application to run.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
