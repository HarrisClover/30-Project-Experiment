The task is a web page that displays a field for entering a verification code. It prompts the user to enter a 6-digit code, which is sent to their email address "cool_guy@email.com" to confirm the email address.Let's think step by step===============================
1. Design the Web Page: The first step is to design a web page that includes a field for entering the verification code. This can be done using HTML and CSS. The page should be simple and user-friendly, with clear instructions on what the user needs to do.

2. Create the Verification Code: The next step is to create a 6-digit verification code. This can be done using a random number generator in a server-side language like PHP or Node.js. The code should be unique for each user.

3. Send the Verification Code: Once the code is generated, it needs to be sent to the user's email address. This can be done using an email service like SendGrid or Mailgun. The email should include the verification code and instructions on how to enter it on the web page.

4. Enter the Verification Code: The user will then enter the verification code into the field on the web page. This can be done using a form in HTML.

5. Verify the Code: Once the user submits the form, the server needs to verify that the code entered matches the one that was sent to the user's email. This can be done using a server-side language like PHP or Node.js.

6. Confirm the Email Address: If the codes match, the server should confirm the email address. This can be done by updating the user's account in the database to indicate that the email address has been verified.

7. Display Confirmation: Finally, the web page should display a confirmation message to the user, letting them know that their email address has been verified.

8. Error Handling: In case the user enters a wrong code, the system should be able to handle this by displaying an appropriate error message and prompting the user to try again.

9. Security Measures: It's important to implement security measures to prevent abuse of the system. For example, you could limit the number of times a user can attempt to enter a verification code, or you could require a certain amount of time to pass before a new code can be requested. 

10. Testing: Lastly, ensure to thoroughly test the system to ensure it works as expected and is user-friendly.===============================

        document.getElementById('message').style.color = 'green';

end script.js

Note: This is a simple example and does not include the server-side code for generating and sending the verification code. It also uses the browser's local storage to store the verification code, which is not secure and should not be used in a real-world application.===============================
