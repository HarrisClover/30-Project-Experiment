To implement this task, we will use Flask, a micro web framework written in Python. We will also use the smtplib for sending emails in Python. The project will be structured as follows:

- A main application file that will serve as the entry point of our application.
- A templates directory that will contain our HTML templates.
- A static directory that will contain our CSS files for styling.
- A requirements.txt file that will list all the Python dependencies that our project needs.

Let's start with the main application file:

app.py
