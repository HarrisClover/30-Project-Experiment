To implement a responsive homepage for a website, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will use Bootstrap for responsiveness and jQuery for some JavaScript functionalities. 

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the homepage.
2. style.css: This file will contain all the custom CSS styles for the homepage.
3. script.js: This file will contain all the custom JavaScript code for the homepage.
4. package.json: This file will contain all the dependencies for the project.

Let's start with the entry point file:

index.html
