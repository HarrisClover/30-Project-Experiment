# Login Page User Manual

## Introduction
The Login Page is a web-based application that allows users to authenticate themselves by entering their username and password. This user manual provides detailed instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies and how to use the Login Page.

## Installation
To use the Login Page, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Flask (version 1.1.2)

You can install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the Login Page, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.

2. Run the following command to start the Flask server:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. Open a web browser and enter the following URL:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. You will see the login page with two input fields for username and password. Enter your credentials and click the "Login" button.

5. If the authentication is successful, you will see a message saying "Login successful!". Otherwise, you will see a message saying "Invalid username or password!".

## Customization
You can customize the login page by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Here are the files you can modify:

- `login.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the login page. You can modify the layout, add additional fields, or change the styling.

- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the login page. You can modify the styles to match your desired design.

- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for handling the form submission and making an AJAX request to the server-side authentication logic. You can modify the code to add additional functionality or customize the behavior.

## Server-side Authentication Logic
The server-side authentication logic is implemented in the `authenticate_user` function in the `authentication.py` file. By default, the function checks if the username is "admin" and the password is "password". You can modify this function to implement your own authentication logic, such as checking against a database or an external authentication service.

## Conclusion
The Login Page provides a simple and customizable user authentication system. By following the installation and usage instructions in this user manual, you can easily create a login page for your web application and implement your own server-side authentication logic.
