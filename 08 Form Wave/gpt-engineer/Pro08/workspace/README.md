Sure, let's create a simple login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will also use Bootstrap for styling and jQuery for handling the form submission and AJAX request.

Here are the files we will need:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the login form.
2. style.css: This file will contain all the custom CSS styles.
3. script.js: This file will contain the JavaScript code for handling the form submission and AJAX request.
4. package.json: This file will contain all the dependencies for the project.

Let's start with the `index.html` file:
